\subsection{
	\normalfont
	Let $a, b$ and $c$ be real numbers where $a \neq b$. If $c^3 = b^3 + b^3 + 3abc$, prove that $c=a+b$.
}

\solution

During the last lecture we learned about the following theorem and it's corollary.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm1}
	Let $a, b$ and $c$ be real numbers.
	\[ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{corollary}\label{cor1}
	Let $a, b$ and $c$ be real numbers.

	If $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$, then either $a = b = c$ or $a + b + c = 0$ is true.
\end{corollary}

We start by rearrange the equation $ c^3 = b^3 + b^3 + 3abc $ into the following form:
\[ -a^3 - b^3 + c^3 = 3abc \]
This equation is now in the form of Corollary \ref{cor1}. Therefore we can conclude that either $-a = -b = -c$ or $-a - b + c = 0$ is true.

We know that $ -a = -b = -c $ is false since $a \neq b$. This leaves us with $-a - b + c = 0$, which we can easily rearrange into the form of $c = a + b$, thus proving the problem.

\subsection{
	\normalfont
	Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ be nonzero real numbers such that
	\[x + y + z = a,\ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{a}\]
	Show that at least one of $x$, $y$, $z$ is equal to $a$.
}

\solution

We begin by recognizing that either $a - x$, $a - y$ or $a - z$ is equal to zero. Thus we can rephrase the problem into proving that $ (a - x)(a - y)(a - z) = 0 $.

Using the theorem we learned during the lesson we can expand the following expression.
\[(a-x)(a-y)(a-z) = a^3 - (x + y + z)a^2 + (xy + yz + zx)a - xyz\]
Substituting $a$ for $ x + y + z $, the expression $a^3 - a^3$ cancels out.
\[(a-x)(a-y)(a-z) = (xy + yz + zx)a - xyz\]
We divide $xy + yz + zx$ by $xyz$ and multiply it by $xyz$ to cancel out the division.
\[(a-x)(a-y)(a-z) = xyz\left(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z}\right)a - xyz\]
Now we can substitute $ \frac{1}{a} $ for $ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} $ we get $ xyz\frac{a}{a} - xyz $. The fraction $ \frac{a}{a} $ cancels out, leading to $xyz - xyz$ also cancelling out.
This leaves us with
\[(a-x)(a-y)(a-z) = 0\]
This proves that either $a - x$, $a - y$ or $a - z$ is equal to zero and therefore either $a$, $b$ or $c$ is equal to $a$.

\subsection{
	\normalfont
	Solve the following system:
	\begin{align*}
		x + y + z       & = 10   \\
		x^2 + y^2 + z^2 & = 100  \\
		x^3 + y^3 + z^3 & = 1000
	\end{align*}
}

\solution

During a past lecture we learned about the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm2}
	Let $a, b$ and $c$ be real numbers.
	\[ (a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) \]
\end{theorem}

Let's begin by writing out Theorem \ref{thm2}.
\[ (a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) \]
We can substitute $10$ and $1000$ for $x + y + z$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3$ respectively. This leaves us with $1000 = 1000 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)$,
which we can simplify to $0 = (a + b)(b + c)(c + a)$.

Therefore we conclude that either $x + y = 0$ or $y + z = 0$ or $z + x = 0$ is true.
Since the sum of one of the pairs of variables is equal to $0$, we conclude that the third variable is equal to $10$ using the fact that $x + y + z = 10$.

To find the values of the other pair of variables let's temporarily assume that $z$ is equal to $10$. Inserting this value into the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 100$, it then simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 = 0$.
Because the exponents in the terms $x^2$ and $y^2$ are both even, they are also nonnegative. Since they are nonnegative and add up to $0$, they both need to be equal to $0$.

From this we can conclude that there are three different solutions to the original system:
\begin{align*}
	x & = 10 &  &           & y & = 10 &  &           & z & = 10 \\
	y & = 0  &  & \text{or} & z & = 10 &  & \text{or} & x & = 0  \\
	z & = 0  &  &           & x & = 10 &  &           & y & = 0
\end{align*}

\subsection{
	\normalfont
	Let $a, b$ and $c$ be real numbers such that $a + b + c = 0$. Show that $2(a^5 + b^5 + c^5) = 5abc(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$.
}

\solution

Since $a + b + c = 0$, we can derive the following equation using Theorem \ref{thm1}, mentioned in Problem A.
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
	abc = \frac{1}{3}(a^3 + b^3 + c^3)
\end{equation}

Let's consider the expression $5abc(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$.
Using Equation \ref{eq1} we substitute $\frac{1}{3}(a^3 + b^3 + c^3)$ for $abc$, resulting in the expression $\frac{5}{3}(a^3 + b^3 + c^3)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$.
After expanding and factorising we are left with the following expression.
\[ \frac{5}{3}\bigl(a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + a^2b^2(a + b) + b^2c^2(b + c) + c^2a^2(c + a)\bigr) \]

Since $a + b + c = 0$, we can derive the following three equations.
\begin{align*}
	-a & = b + c \\
	-b & = c + a \\
	-c & = a + b
\end{align*}
Using these equations we substitute $-a, -b$ and $-c$ into our expression to get the expression $\frac{5}{3}(a^5 + b^5 + c^5 - a^2b^2c - ab^2c^2 - a^2bc^2)$.
After factorising $abc$ we are left with the following result.
\[ \frac{5}{3}\bigl(a^5 + b^5 + c^5 - abc(ab + bc + ca)\bigr) \]

We learned about the following theorem during a past lecture.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm3}
	Let $a, b$ and $c$ be real numbers.
	\[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \]
\end{theorem}
Consider the equation $a + b + c = 0$. This means that the equation $(a + b + c)^2 = 0$ is also true.
Using Theorem \ref{thm3} we can modify the equation to get the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 0$, which after rearranging gives us the following result.
\[ ab + bc + ca = -\frac{1}{2}\size2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\size2) \]

Returning to the previous expression we can now substitute $-\frac{1}{2}\size2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\size2)$ for $ab + bc + ca$,
giving us the following result.
\[ \frac{5}{3}\size3(a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + \frac{1}{2}abc\size2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\size2)\size3) \]

As we derived this expression from the previous expression $5abc\size2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\size2)$, the following equation holds true.
\begin{equation*}
	5abc\size2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\size2) = \frac{5}{3}\size2(a^5 + b^5 + c^5\size2) + \frac{5}{6}abc\size2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\size2)
\end{equation*}

Multiplying the preceding equation by $\frac{6}{5}$ and then simplifying it gives us the resulting equation $2(a^5 + b^5 + c^5) = 5abc(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$,
which is the equation we set out to prove.


\subsection{
	\normalfont
	Let $a, b$ and $c$ be nonzero real numbers such that $a + b + c = 0$ and $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$.
	Determine the exact value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$.
	\hint Expand $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(a^3 + b^3 + c^3)$
}

\solution

Let's do as the problem asks and begin expanding the expression $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(a^3 + b^3 + c^3)$.
This results in the following expression.
\[ a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + a^3b^2 + a^2b^3 + b^3c^2 + b^2c^3 + c^3a^2 + c^2a^3 \]
After substituting $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ for $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ and factorising we are left with the following expression.
